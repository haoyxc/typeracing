# Warmup Exercise: React refresher

## Time limit: 15 minutes

## Goal

Build a simple counter app using React. It should display a counter, starting at
zero, and have three buttons:

- "+": Increment the count by one
- "-": Decrement the count by one
- "Increment if odd": Like it says

See the demo of the live version.

## Instructions

Use [this codepen](http://codepen.io/lockehart/pen/oLZLRv?editors=0010) as a starting point.
Note that React and ReactDOM have already been included for you. You don't need
to `require` any react-related functions. You can just begin writing your react
code.
